This program runs several tests on the code written by Ryan Buxman to check for correct and logical output

    -Check parameters.py to first of make sure it read and copied everything correct from the config file
    -Then check and see how good it catches logic errors
    -Check to see if the assigned defaults don't negatively affect the code

    -Check stress_strain_curve.py to see if it correctly copies and converts the data (into pif and panda)

    -Check to see if it correctly reverses data when in compression
